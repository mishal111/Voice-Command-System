Friday is a lightweight Python-based voice assistant that listens for the wake word “friday” and executes voice-controlled system commands on Linux. Built using the SpeechRecognition library, the assistant uses microphone input and Google’s online speech recognition to process commands, while playsound3 provides audio feedback when activated. Once triggered, Friday can open applications such as Firefox, Spotify, and Visual Studio Code, and can also terminate itself when instructed. The project requires Python 3, a functional microphone, an internet connection, and installation of dependencies including SpeechRecognition, playsound3, and PyAudio (with PortAudio installed on the system). Users may customize the wake sound file path to match their local system. After installation, the assistant is launched by running the Python script, after which it continuously listens in the background using a multithreaded loop. Future improvements may include offline speech processing, customizable commands, expanded application support, and a graphical user interface.
